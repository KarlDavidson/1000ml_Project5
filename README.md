# Project 5 - Financial

-----------------------

## Objective

Using banking data from 1999, analyze the clients with an existing, paid or defaulted loan and identify what factors influence successful/unsuccessful full loan payments.

Then, possibly create a model to determine what other account holders that do not presently have a loan and have not previously had a loan would be most likely to complete loan payments, so that the bank could offer them one.
